This section is an archive of my recent creative collaborations with various visual artists, fiction writers and other researchers. Most of the projects below speak directly to the notion of energy futures, though I have also thrown in a few artefacts which relate to digital innovations more broadly.

I'm committed to engaging with the notion of energy futures far beyond academia. Too often, sociotechnical research is presented solely as a critique, often in journals already receptive to the messages calling for just transitions to sustainable futures. Instead, my approach focuses on foregrounding forgotten histories of innovation successes and failures, celebrating maintenance workers and questioning the nature of error and repair. I hope that our fiction, illustrations and interactive displays will galvanise a new chapter in the public debate about energy digitalisation.

The works have been presented across several locations in Europe, some independent venues like [Cafe Kino](https://www.headfirstbristol.co.uk/whats-on/cafe-kino/fri-9-jun-electric-feels-89296#e89296), and some household names like the [V&A Digital Design Weekend](https://www.vam.ac.uk/event/5Oz7Jmvd6Q/digital-design-weekend-2023). I am now in process of arranging public engagement activities for our current projects on digital twins and energy cyber security resilience--watch this spcae! Please [get in touch](mailto:ola.michalec@bristol.ac.uk) if you'd could direct me to suitable locations or if you'd like to host us. We welcome venues which could exhibit a few small artefacts and/or accommodate a book (fiction) launch!

Over the next few weeks, I will be uploading further text and files from the creative projects below:
