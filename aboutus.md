<br />
Hello world! My name is Ola Michalec and I have built this website! I'm a Lecturer in Digital Futures and I'm based at the University of Bristol Business School and [Bristol Digital Futures Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristol-digital-futures-institute/).

My research interests revolve around understanding how experts from diverse fields collaborate on digital innovations. Over the past decade, I have applied this question to the context of critical infrastructures, cyber security, and energy industry. I contribute to debates in Science and Technology Studies and play an active role in communities engaging researchers with practitioners such as [Research Institute for Sociotechnical Cyber Security](https://riscs.org.uk/). I'm also a co-founder of [Hype Studies Group](https://hypestudies.org/), a new initiative aiming to understand how trends, innovation narratives and buzzwords influence technology and science.

### Design
The website has been built by me with help from the Beautiful Jekyll template. Tips and feedback welcome--so far, I've been really enjoying learning the basics of web design! 

Wondering why a website on energy *futures* would showcase glitchy gifs of old machinery and technicolour-inspired palette? Through this design, I wanted to challenge common tropes about the future and tech. Perhaps you've encountered images of [android sexy robots](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.e10CQ3hCStIuCpxHCp1TtAHaHa&pid=Api), [male hands in suits touching a computer screen](https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2021/09/17/IA.png), or [scyscrapers connected by beams of light](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.zfGQm6Ki3IcUBsVluCtR0AHaE8?pid=Api). Too often, digital futures are represented as immaterial, apolitical and yet...a little bit boring? The design of this site aims to challenge those mainstream aesthetics. After all, energy futures aren’t built on fantasy but on frictions, failures, and mundane realities of routine maintenance checks.
