### Book launch: "New Colours: Visions of Digital Twins" by Jonny Heath


We're excited to share our collection of short stories, poems and illustration by a Bristol-based author, [Jonny Heath](https://www.patreon.com/jonnywriteswords)! Earlier this year, Jonny and I engaged in a creative exchange process reflecting on how digital twins are discussed in research. Over endless cups of coffee, I told Jonny about some amusing, terrifying and sometimes audacious claims I heard during digital twin events. The resulting stories capture the eeriness of the promise of accurate representation ('twinning'), so often present in glossy brochures of innovators. However, rather than simply leaning onto the well-known tropes of 'cautionary tales' so common in sci-fi, we're hoping the stories will help us reflect what's so seductive about resemblance, modelling and prediction in the first place.

The stories are complemented with illustrations by [Eve Pyra](https://www.evepyra.com/illustration-portfolio) and cover design and typesetting by [Wen Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wen-li-038787141/). 

You can access the story for free here - please don't forget to credit the team if citing the works! The images are subject to copyright.
